<p class="main-menu-text">
Math is an amazing subject I always look forward to every day. We are beginning to learn about points, lines, and planes; these 3 objects define how we live and how engineers build structures. There are formulas that find the distance between two points on a plane and the midpoint between two points on a plane. The reason I enjoy math is because if your answer is mathematically right, one cannot argue against it — there is proof it’s correct, unlike subjects like English where it’s based on opinions and sources like the New York Times.

<h2 class="math-title-1">What is Geometry?</h2>

<p class="math-info-1">
Geometry is the study of shapes, lines, and space. It starts with three basic ideas — points, lines, and planes — which we accept without formal definition. A point represents a location, a line extends infinitely in both directions, and a plane is a flat surface stretching forever. Using proper notation and clear labeling is key to avoiding mistakes.
</p>

<br>

<h2 class="math-title-2">Segments and Midpoints</h2>

<p class="math-info-2">
A segment is a finite piece of a line with two endpoints. If point B lies between points A and C, the Segment Addition Postulate tells us AB + BC = AC. Congruent segments have equal lengths (≅), and a segment bisector passes through the midpoint of a segment.
</p>

<br>

<h2 class="math-title-3">Distance Between Points</h2>

<p class="math-info-3">
The distance formula calculates how far apart two points are: <br>
<strong>d = √((x₂ − x₁)² + (y₂ − y₁)²)</strong> <br>
The midpoint formula finds the center of a segment: <br>
<strong>M = ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2)</strong>
</p>

<br>

<h2 class="math-title-4">Angles and Their Relationships</h2>

<p class="math-info-4">
Angles are formed by two rays sharing a common endpoint (vertex). Angles can be acute, right, obtuse, or straight. The Angle Addition Postulate states that if a point lies inside an angle, the sum of the two smaller angles equals the whole angle. Understanding complementary, supplementary, vertical, and linear pair angles helps solve problems and proofs.
</p>

<br>

<h2 class="math-title-5">Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul class="math-points-1">
  <li>Label diagrams clearly: points, lines, planes, segments, and angles.</li>
  <li>Use the Segment Addition Postulate: AB + BC = AC when B is between A and C.</li>
  <li>Distance and midpoint formulas allow calculation of lengths and centers of segments.</li>
  <li>Angles can be classified and added using the Angle Addition Postulate.</li>
  <li>Vertical and linear pair angles have predictable relationships useful in proofs.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2 class="math-opinion-title">Why I enjoy Math</h2>

<p class="math-opinion">
In my opinion, geometry is one of my favorite math topics because it combines logical reasoning with visual problem-solving. Working through segments, angles, and proofs strengthens critical thinking and helps me visualize relationships in space. Solving these problems accurately also improves attention to detail and mathematical rigor, which I find rewarding.
